# Social Buzz Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Social Buzz, established in 2010 and headquartered in San Francisco, is a leading social media and content creation platform that has revolutionized online interaction. With over 500 million active users monthly, Social Buzz is known for its innovative approach, offering a plethora of interaction methods. As the company gears up for its IPO, it is imperative to refine its data strategies to sustain and manage its growth effectively.

This project aims to support Social Buzz through a critical period by auditing its big data practices, providing strategic guidance for its IPO, and analyzing content categories to determine the top five in terms of popularity. These insights will help steer content strategy and enhance user engagement.

### Problem Statement

Social Buzz faces the challenge of extracting actionable insights from its extensive user data. Our main objective for data analytics task is to analyze this data with a focus on identifying the top 5 content categories, thus informing content curation, enhancing user experience, and supporting the company's IPO preparations.

## Findings and Conclusions

- The categories 'animals', 'science', 'healthy eating', 'technology', and 'food' are the top 5 in terms of user engagement on Social Buzz
- Certain content categories consistently engage users more positively than others.
- Information of users reactions/sentiments across categories and content types can help enhancing content strategy
- The number of unique active users shows both stability and variability, indicating both successful user retention strategies and areas needing attention.
- Seasonal trends and specific events seem to have a noticeable impact on user engagement.

### Limitations

- The dataset may not capture the complete picture of user engagement due to potential missing data or unrecorded user interactions during several campaigns.
- The user base's response to platform changes or external factors was not within the scope of this analysis.

### Challenges

The team dealt with missing data, the complexity of interpreting sentiments, and unexpected changes in user activity.

### Achievements

Key milestones include a clear understanding of engaging content categories, identification of content types that drive positive sentiment, and visualization of engagement patterns.

### Recommendations

We suggest increasing content in high-engagement categories, investigating recent user activity drops, and planning seasonal marketing strategies.
